			 Outside of studies, Jin enjoys learning languages, traveling to different countries and practicing Taekwondo. 
			 He believes that experiences both inside and outside one's cultural knowledge help individual growth, 
			 and that they hold potential for interesting stories.
			 <br><br>
             Throughout the years, he has grown to have a deep fascination for East Asian mythology and folklore, 
			 particularly within Korea and Japan. 
			 He strives to bring his understandings about cultures and technology together within his work. 
			 <br><br>
			 His passion for writing and learning more about his Korean heritage has led to collaborating with an artist to publish a comic 
			 in <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1031125241/wanderlust-a-mythology-anthology"><b>WANDERLUST, A Mythology Anthology.</b></a> 
			 Jin is also a former member of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oorimit/"><b>MIT's Oori Samulnori group</b></a>! 
			 Given time and space, he practices playing bassoon,
			 and hopes to be part of a professional orchestra in the future.
			 <br><br>
			 He has a variety of work experiences, from tutoring in English and Japanese, developing and teaching tech-camp curricula for kids,
			 documentation and creation of company-wide training material, 
			 to intensive psychological research through the scope of game design.
			 <br><br>
			 Jin is a native-level speaker of English, is near-fluent in Korean and conversationally fluent in Japanese. He has lived
			 in most regions of the U.S. as well as Osaka, Japan and Seoul, South Korea. He hopes to learn Mandarin Chinese, Tibetan and Sanskrit as well.
			 <br><br>
			 As an avid fan of science fiction, 
			 some of his favorite books are Terry Pratchett's "Thief of Time," Liu Cixin's "The Wandering Earth" and Samuel R. Delaney's "Babel-17."
