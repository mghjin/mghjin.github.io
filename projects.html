			<p class="text-faded">
			The game was inspired by Korean folklore about "Imugi," also known as lesser dragons. 
			The narrative follows the Imugi character in its descending journey to find strength, wisdom, and empathy
			before then catching a pearl from heaven.
			<br><br>
			The player takes on the role of one such Imugi and must find virtues to become a fully grown dragon. 
			The design goal was for players to feel like they were descending through the maze-like ocean as they searched for the virtues, 
			encountering enemies, obstacles, and bits of story along the way.  
			<br><br>
			The further they descend, the more mysterious and chaotic the game becomes. 
			<br><br>
			In an underwater world filled with strange items with histories and enemies to slay, 
			the Imugi's journey to collect the Three Virtues will not be easy...

			Jin worked as the Project Lead for this student project.
			<br><br>
			A game inspired by a certain college student's desperate need for coffee on a late school night, 
			CRUNCHTIME is a board/card game with the premise of being... university students studying for a final exam!
			Unleash your unfortunate college student powers as a Coffee Hound and hoard INT!!
			<br><br>
			Everyone seems to have been slacking on their studies and starts with zero INT, which you need to pass exams. 
			Players play through a total of seven turns with each turn representing one day. 
			They must perform the available action cards in their hand to either Study, 
			or manage their Stress levels so they won't get docked one Hit Point permanently. 
			Beware low energy days, for player action points are greatly reduced in comparison to high energy days.
			<br><br>
			But wait, Your physical and mental health is important too! Neglect these, and your performance during your final examinations will suffer.
			<br><br>
			You have the choice to study with a buddy, cram the last two days with unhealthy combinations of coffee and energy drinks,
			go stress shopping and see derivatives everywhere...
			<br><br>Or perhaps even give up on your studies and prank your friends instead!
