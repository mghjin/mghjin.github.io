			<h4><u>Project Description</u>:</h4>
			<p>A research game project designed to test the psychological concept of "conformity" and "obedience" within the cyberpunk environment and narrative.
			As the player progresses through the levels, their decisions will impact gameplay in subsequent levels, as well as the player's personal ending.</p>
			<p>Users play the game as ELI_007, the seventh version of an artificial intelligence entity that was created to eliminate “viruses” within its parent system. 
			Unbeknownst to the player, these viruses are actually the uploaded consciousnesses of humans that have been stored through ARK. 
			At the start of the game, the player is given a simple directive: eliminate all viruses and progress through each sector until you hit the center of the data cache.</p>
			<p>This study’s aim is to analyze players’ responses to situations in which they may feel forced to conform and remain obedient to a system they do not feel aligned with. 
			Through designing and playtesting our digital prototype, we seek to gauge what percentage of participants defy their orders, 
			and whether or not we are successful in portraying these psychological concepts through our digital prototype.</p>

			<h4><u>Project Description</u>:</h4>
			<p>The game was inspired by Korean folklore about "Imugi", also known as lesser dragons. The narrative follows the Imugi character in its descending journey to find strength, wisdom, and empathy
			before then catching a pearl from heaven.</p>
			<p>The player takes on the role of one such Imugi and must find virtues to become a fully grown dragon. 
			The design goal was for players to feel like they were descending through the maze-like ocean as they searched for the virtues, 
			encountering enemies, obstacles, and bits of story along the way.  
			The further they descend, the more mysterious and chaotic the game becomes. 
			Vision becomes more occluded and enemies chase the player rather than stay on a specified path. </p>
			<p>In an underwater world filled with strange items with histories and enemies to slay, the Imugi's journey to collect the Three Virtues will not be easy...</p>

			<h4><u>Project Duration</u>:</h4> 6 weeks, Fall 2018
			<p></p>
			<h4><u>Project Description</u>:</h4>
			<p>A game inspired by a certain college student's desperate need for coffee on a late school night. CRUNCHTIME is a board/card game with the premise of being... university students studying for a final exam!
			Unleash your ungodly college student powers as a Coffee Hound and hoard INT!!</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>You are a group of students all cramming the week before your final exams begin. Everyone seems to have been slacking on their studies
			and starts with 0 INT, the stat you want to raise most to pass your exams. Players play through a total of seven turns with each turn representing one day. They must perform the available action cards
			in their hand to either Study, or manage their Stress levels so they won't get docked one Hit Point permanently. Beware low energy days, for player
			action points are greatly reduced in comparison to high energy days. </p>
			<p>But wait, Your physical and mental health is important too! Neglect these, and your performance during your final examinations will suffer!</p>
			<p>Study with a buddy! Cram the last two days with unhealthy combinations of coffee 
			and energy drinks! Go stress shopping and see derivatives everywhere! Or perhaps even give up on your studies and prank your friends instead!</p>
